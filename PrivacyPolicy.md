**Privacy Policy for RoValra Chrome Extension**

**Effective Date:** 1/10/25

**Introduction**

This Privacy Policy describes how the RoValra Chrome extension ("the Extension") handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

**Information We Do Not Collect**

RoValra does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) from users. This includes but is not limited to names, email addresses, browsing history, or any other data that could be used to identify you. We do not use any third-party services or APIs other than Roblox itself.

**Use of IP Address and Geolocation (Client-Side)**

The Extension utilizes your IP address and geolocation information **only on your local device** to interact with the Roblox platform. This is to enhance the functionality of the extension. The extension uses your ip address to generate the appropriate roblox servers based on your location.

**Important points about IP/geolocation usage:**

*   **No server storage:** Your IP address and geolocation data are processed entirely within your browser and **are not sent to or stored on any external servers controlled by us or third parties.**
*   **Client-side only:** All processing of IP/geolocation data is done within your browser window and does not leave your local system.
*   **Limited Functionality:** The information is used to interact with Roblox’s API solely to provide the intended functionality of the extension.

**Data Security**

As the extension does not store or send data to servers, traditional security measures like server-side encryption are not necessary. All processing occurs on your local machine.

**Third-Party Services**

As you have indicated, RoValra only interacts with Roblox’s API and does not use any other third-party services.

**Data Retention**

Since the extension does not collect or store any personal information, there is no need to retain any data.

**Children's Privacy**

The Extension is designed to not collect any personal data. As such, it does not violate the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we will update the “Effective Date.” Your continued use of the Extension after any changes signifies your acceptance of the new policy.
