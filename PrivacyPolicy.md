**Privacy Policy for RoValra Chrome Extension**

**Effective Date:** 3/16/25

**Introduction**

This Privacy Policy describes how the RoValra Chrome extension ("the Extension") handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

**Information We Do Not Collect**

RoValra does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) from users. This includes, but is not limited to, names, email addresses, browsing history, or any other data that could be used to identify you. The Extension only interacts with Roblox's services and APIs, as well as one API controlled by the developer (Valra). More details about this API can be found in the **Third-Party Services** section.

**Use of IP Address and Geolocation (Client-Side)**

The Extension utilizes your IP address and geolocation information **only on your local device** to interact with the Roblox platform. This enhances the functionality of the extension by allowing it to generate the appropriate Roblox servers based on your location.

**Important points about IP/geolocation usage:**

*   **No server storage:** Your IP address and geolocation data are processed entirely within your browser and **are not sent to or stored on any external servers controlled by us or third parties.**
*   **Client-side only:** All processing of IP/geolocation data is done within your browser window and does not leave your local system.
*   **Limited Functionality:** The information is used exclusively to interact with Roblox’s API and provide the intended functionality of the extension.

**Data Security**

As the extension does not store or transmit data to external servers, traditional security measures like server-side encryption are not necessary. All processing occurs on your local machine.

**Third-Party Services**

RoValra only interacts with Roblox’s API and one additional API controlled by the developer (Valra). This API is used solely to retrieve data necessary for features within the extension. **No data is logged, and no data is sent to the API.** The API is strictly used for retrieving information required for the extension's functionality.

**Data Retention**

Since the extension does not collect or store any personal information, there is no need to retain any data.

**Children's Privacy**

The Extension is designed not to collect any personal data. As such, it complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we will update the “Effective Date.” Your continued use of the Extension after any changes signifies your acceptance of the new policy.
