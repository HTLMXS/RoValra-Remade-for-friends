# Known incompatibilies
The extension is unable to show the hidden games of groups if you use RoSeal with the "Seamless navigation of communities" setting on.

The different states in the US isnt showing. It is bc of limitations with the IP location checker.

Some servers might not show like France, again bc of limitations bc of the IP location checker.

Im also gonna be making the region selector look better in the next update

# Known issues

The show server button (for server regions) shows up in the friend list tab and might show up in other places.

# How to install
