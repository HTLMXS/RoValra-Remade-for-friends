# Known incompatibilies
<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
- **The extension is unable to show the hidden games of groups if you use [RoSeal](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/roseal-augmented-roblox-e/hfjngafpndganmdggnapblamgbfjhnof?hl=en) with the "Seamless navigation of communities" setting on.**

- **The different states in the US isnt showing. It is bc of limitations with the IP location checker.**

- **Some servers might not show like France, again bc of limitations bc of the IP location checker.**
- **If you are located in the US the Best Ping button wont work. Dw there is a warning if you press it just in case**
