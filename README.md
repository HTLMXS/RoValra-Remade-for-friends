  - Basically this feature allows you to join anyone with their joins on or whose on ur friends list instantly.
  
  - lets say for example you wanna join someone whose streaming a game with viewers, you could just use the snipe feature, and you would almost instantly join (Depending on your pc ofc)
  - Confirmed to work with popular peoeple like kreekcraft.

# Known incompatibilies
<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
- **The extension is unable to show the hidden games of groups if you use [RoSeal](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/roseal-augmented-roblox-e/hfjngafpndganmdggnapblamgbfjhnof?hl=en) with the "Seamless navigation of communities" setting on.**

- **Some servers might not show like France (Might actually be cuz Roblox either change the servers ip or stopped running them)**
- **If you are located in the US the Best Ping button wont work. Dw there is a warning if you press it just in case**
