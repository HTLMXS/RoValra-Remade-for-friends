- **And more to come, if you have a feature you want me to add just lmk**

# To try list
- [ ] ~~Making the region selector not rely on RoQoL (I dont know if this is possible without server cost)~~
- **Im not able to add this sadly. If you know an easy way of how to block roblox from overwriting the user agent please dm me on dc (Valra)**

# Known incompatibilies
- **The extension is unable to show the hidden games of groups if you use RoSeal with the "Seamless navigation of communities" setting on.**
- **The different states in the US isnt showing. It is bc of limitations with the IP location checker.**
- **Some servers might not show like France, again bc of limitations bc of the IP location checker.**
